# Customer-Churn-Analysis---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors influencing customer attrition.

The primary goal of this analysis is to understand:

- Why customers are churning  
- Which customer segments are at higher risk  
- What behavioral and service-related factors influence churn  
- How the company can reduce churn using data-driven strategies

By analyzing demographic features, tenure, contract types, service usage, and payment methods, this project transforms raw data into actionable business insights.


## 🔎 The findings from this analysis can help the organization:

- Demographic analysis (e.g., senior citizens vs non-senior citizens)
- Tenure analysis (new vs long-term customers)
- Contract type comparison (month-to-month vs long-term contracts)
- Service usage impact (InternetService, OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, etc.)
- Payment method influence on churn

## 💡 Business Impact

By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, this analysis helps the company:

- Improve customer retention strategies  
- Identify high-risk customers early  
- Optimize service offerings  
- Increase long-term customer loyalty and profitability
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
